      <description>In this post, I explored enhancing Autogen&amp;rsquo;s capabilities by enabling seamless Java code execution. Drawing inspiration from 0xlws&amp;rsquo; fork supporting JavaScript, I embarked on modifying Autogen to robustly support Java. I detailed the setup process, including installing Java on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and modifying key files. The post includes code snippets showcasing the changes, recompilation steps, and instructions for generating Java code. I extended functionality to additional test cases, seamlessly switching between Java and Python code execution. Docker integration for Java code execution was also optimized, showcasing Autogen&amp;rsquo;s versatility and robust development experience.</description>
