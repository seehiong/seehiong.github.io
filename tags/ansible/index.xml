      <description>I documented my journey configuring a Kubernetes Cluster on a Raspberry Pi using Ansible, totaling 50 minutes. I deployed three Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB as master nodes and one Raspberry Pi 3 Model B as a worker. After installing Ansible, Flash, and kubectl, I prepared the SD cards with customized cloud-config.yml files. Ansible inventory was configured accordingly. Additional SSH and system adjustments were made on each node. Customizations were applied, and the Kubernetes cluster setup was initiated using the Ansible playbook. Troubleshooting tips were provided for potential issues. Finally, the Kubernetes Pi Cluster with Ansible was ready for use.</description>
