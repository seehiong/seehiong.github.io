      <description>In my latest blog post, I share my journey setting up K3S, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, in my home lab. With a step-by-step guide, I install K3S on an Ubuntu Server 22.04.2 LTS, offering a seamless experience. The post covers creating useful aliases for simplifying interactions with K3S and verifying the installation. Additionally, I introduce Portainer to manage Docker and Kubernetes in my home lab. I walk through setting up Portainer, adding a Kubernetes environment, and connecting it to the K3S cluster. Furthermore, I establish a local Docker registry and demonstrate optional steps for pushing and deploying Docker images within the K3S cluster.</description>
