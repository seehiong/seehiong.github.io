      <description>Enhance your Vue.js application by integrating chat capabilities with Chart.js and LLMs like OpenAI and Deepseek-R1. This post walks through adding a chat node to the Micronaut-Optimizer workflow, enabling dynamic interactions with optimization results. Learn how to configure environment variables, connect workflow nodes, and send Chart.js data to LLMs. See it in action with sample inputs and responses, and explore running Deepseek-R1 locally with Ollama.</description>

      <description>In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the development of a Vue.js frontend application designed to complement my previous work on a flexible optimizer framework built with Micronaut. This frontend provides a visual interface for designing, managing, and optimizing workflows, with a focus on solving combinatorial optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The app features a drag-and-drop UI, enabling users to define optimization problems graphically without relying on tools like Postman. By connecting inputs, transformations, and outputs through Workflow Nodes, users can visualize and compare the performance of backend optimization algorithms across different datasets.</description>

      <description>I dedicate around 10 minutes to create BYO-GPT, a Flutter app that allows easy interaction with ChatGPT through OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s API. After installing Flutter, setting up the project, and creating necessary widgets and models, I utilize the OpenAI API for chat completion. The app includes user and GPT message bubbles, as well as a user input section with a GPT icon. By employing the Provider package, the app efficiently manages state changes. Additionally, I provide the option to switch models for experimentation. Overall, BYO-GPT provides a user-friendly interface for seamless communication with ChatGPT.</description>
