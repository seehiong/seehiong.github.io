      <description>In this post, I demonstrated how to deploy a Jupyter notebook using the jupyter-tensorflow-full image in Kubeflow, develop an HDB resale price predictor app with Streamlit, and access it via port forwarding. The setup runs locally and showcases how to bring together machine learning, visualization, and interactivity in a seamless development workflow within Kubeflow.</description>

      <description>In this post, I explore the impact of different feature sets on XGBoost model performance for HDB resale price prediction. By combining numerical, categorical, and engineered features, I conducted a series of experiments and tracked their performance using MLflow. The results reveal how thoughtful feature engineering and selection can significantly influence metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R²—offering valuable insights into building more accurate predictive models.</description>
