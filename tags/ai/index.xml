      <description>In this journey, I explore automating PDF autofill using LangChain and LangFlow. Leveraging LangFlow and OpenAI, I streamline the employment form completion process, demonstrating steps to install LangFlow and set up a PostgreSQL table. Despite encountering challenges in prototyping with LangFlow, the exploration progresses to auto-fill PDFs. After extracting form fields and LLaMA model setup, I employ LangChain to fetch PostgreSQL data. Concluding with Python manipulation to interpolate and update the PDF, the process achieves seamless auto-fill. Dive into the details, overcome challenges, and witness the power of LangChain and LangFlow in revolutionizing PDF automation.</description>

      <description>In continuation from my previous post, I prepared the environment using Pipenv and installed the OpenAI-like web server with specific CMAKE arguments. Running the server with a provided model was straightforward. To create an SSH tunnel to the remote Ubuntu machine from my Windows PC, I used PuTTY, configuring it to forward port 8888. Connecting from BYO-GPT involved adjusting the server endpoint in the Dart file. This seamless integration allowed me to access the Open API for the LLAMA CPP server and successfully connect BYO-GPT to the specified server.</description>

      <description>In this post, I extend the use case from my previous post to demonstrate building a ChatBot for PDF files using LangChain. In the preparation phase, I install Chroma, an open-source embedding database, and ingest a PDF file using PyPDFLoader. I then split the document into chunks and use Chroma&amp;rsquo;s default embeddings. Due to a potential issue, I provide an alternative embedding approach. Next, I load a local LLaMA model, prepare for question-answering, and run queries using RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain. I also touch on running with OpenBLAS for optimization. The guide empowers users to explore personalized question-answering over their PDF documents.</description>
