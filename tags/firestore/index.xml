      <description>Living Storybook explores what happens when storytelling is treated as a system rather than a stream of text. This post walks through the architecture behind a multiverse-aware writing tool that supports branching narratives, causal persistence, and human–AI co-authoring. From timeline reconstruction and chapter blueprints to validation guards and stateful characters, it shows how narrative, planning, and control flow come together to make stories that can truly diverge — without losing coherence.</description>

      <description>VoiceDoc Agent is a voice-native document intelligence system built for the AI Partner Catalyst hackathon. It transforms static documents into spoken, conversational experiences using Gemini on Vertex AI, ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech, and Datadog observability. The project demonstrates a production-ready, voice-first architecture with expressive narration, persona-aware responses, real-time metrics, and synthetic traffic testing — showcasing how Google Cloud partner services can be composed into a measurable, scalable AI system.</description>
