      <description>I dedicate around 10 minutes to create BYO-GPT, a Flutter app that allows easy interaction with ChatGPT through OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s API. After installing Flutter, setting up the project, and creating necessary widgets and models, I utilize the OpenAI API for chat completion. The app includes user and GPT message bubbles, as well as a user input section with a GPT icon. By employing the Provider package, the app efficiently manages state changes. Additionally, I provide the option to switch models for experimentation. Overall, BYO-GPT provides a user-friendly interface for seamless communication with ChatGPT.</description>
