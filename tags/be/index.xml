      <description>This post demonstrates solving the Facility Location Problem (FLP) using OR-Tools and Micronaut. It covers defining the solver, variables, constraints, and objective function in Java. The implementation includes creating a Micronaut service and controller to handle file uploads, process the data, and compute the optimal solution. The example input file format and expected outputs are also illustrated, providing a complete guide to implementing and testing the FLP solution.</description>

      <description>In this post, I explore solving a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involving 200 cities using genetic algorithms within a Micronaut framework. Leveraging techniques like inversion, insertion, and swap mutations, I illustrate how to maintain genetic diversity and improve solution quality over generations. The implementation showcases significant performance improvements compared to previous solvers. This approach combines simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and local search to tackle complex optimization challenges effectively.</description>

      <description>In my latest post, I delve into seamlessly integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Java code using Langchain4j. Drawing inspiration from RAG over code, I explore Java Parser&amp;rsquo;s potential for robust codebase analysis. The pivotal JavaParsingService and EmbeddingStoreService orchestrate this integration, enabling users to effortlessly load Java projects and glean profound insights. The enhanced controller boasts user-friendly endpoints, fostering dynamic interactions. Witness Retrieval-Augmented Generation breathe life into Java code, from codebase ingestion to insightful querying with models like gpt4all-j, WizardLM, and OpenAI. This narrative unveils the nuanced capabilities of RAG in querying Java codebases.</description>
